Simple Chat is an incredibly simple chat application. It's intended more as a proof-of-concept than anything elseâ€”no effort is made to support older browsers, there's no formatting, and it doesn't even enforce unique nicknames. Think of it as like a single IRC channel with history logged.

Note that the history is stored as a plain text file; you can use a grain backup to easily retrieve a channel activity log.
